  <p class="bio-para">
    To drive on a public road in South Africa transporting goods, dangerous goods or passengers for an income you must have a professional driving permit (PrDP).<br><br>

    The permit is issued in addition to an ordinary driving licence. A PrDP applies to the following motor vehicle categories:<br><br>
    
    &#8226; A goods vehicle with a gross vehicle mass exceeding 3 500kg.<br>
    &#8226; A breakdown vehicle or a bus.<br>
    &#8226; A minibus weighing more than 3 500kg or designed to carry 12 or more people (the driver included).<br> 
    &#8226; Light motor vehicles, indicated in the economic sector for carrying passengers for reward (taxi-cab).<br>
    &#8226; A motor vehicle designed to carry 12 or more people.<br>
    &#8226; Any vehicle for which an operating licence is issued.<br>
    &#8226; Dangerous goods vehicle (e.g. fuel tanker).<br><br>
    Age restrictions for the motor vehicle categories are as follows:<br><br>
    
    &#8226; You should be 18 years or older to hold a PrDP for a goods vehicle<br>
    &#8226; You should be 21 years or older to hold a PrDP for a passenger vehicle<br>
    &#8226; You should be 25 years or older to hold a PrDP for a dangerous goods vehicle.

    You can only obtain a PrDP if you:<br><br>

    &#8226; Have a valid driving licence for the type of vehicle in question<br>
    &#8226; Have been certified as medically fit by a doctor<br> 
    &#8226; Have been certified by an approved training body (only required for category D (dangerous goods) vehicles)<br>
    &#8226; Do not have a criminal record for (in the past five years):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug having a narcotic effect <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; driving a motor vehicle while the concentration of alcohol in your blood or breath exceeded a statutory limitation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;in the case of an application for a category P and D permit, an offence of which violence was an element.<br><br>
    &#8226; Have never had your driving licence suspended<br>
    &#8226; Have never been convicted of a criminal offence or paid an admission-of-guilt fine.<br><br>
    As the operator or owner of the motor vehicle for which a PrDP is required, you may not let another person drive the vehicle on a public road unless they have a valid PrDP for the appropriate category.
