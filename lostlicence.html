    <h3 class="greetings">About replacing a damaged, lost or stolen driving licence card</h3>


  <p class="bio-para">
    If your driving licence card is lost, stolen or damaged, you can apply for a new one.<br><br>

    You will have to apply for a temporary driving licence at an additional cost while waiting for your driving licence card to be issued.<br><br>
    
    To get a replacement card, you will not be required to take a driving licence examination, but you will undergo eye testing and your fingerprints will be taken. Alternatively, you can have your eyes tested by an optometrist and submit the form at the driving license testing centre (DLTC).<br>
